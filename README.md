# Sentiment Analysis of Public Figure

We are using Amazon Comprehend to perform sentiment
analysis on a political figure popularity based on the data
gathered from tweets, showing the results on a dashboard within Amazon QuickSight. This
tool can be easily extended to any entity based on the tweeter
feed for the same analysis.


### Amazon Services Used for implementing the solution

- Amazon Comprehend (NLP)
- Athena (database)
- Lambda functions
- Amazon QuickSight (DashBoard)
- Amazon Kinesis
